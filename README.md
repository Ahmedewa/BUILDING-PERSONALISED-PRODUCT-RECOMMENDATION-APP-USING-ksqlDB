    payload = {
        "user_id": user_id,
        "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)
    }
    token = jwt.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY, algorithm="HS256")
    return token

def verify_token(token):
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
        return payload["user_id"]
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        return "Token expired"
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:

```


1. Source Code and Structure  /TECH STACK:

Directory Structure
We create a directory structure to organize the components of the application:

```
/personalized-recommendation-app
    /kafka
    /ksqldb
    /ml
    /docker
    /security
    docker-compose.yml
```

 Kafka Topic Creation
```bash
kafka-topics --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic customer_behavior
```

 Kafka Producer
```python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))
producer.send('customer_behavior', {'customer_id': '123', 'product_id': 'abc', 'event_type': 'click'})
```

 ksqlDB Stream
```sql
CREATE STREAM customer_behavior (
    customer_id VARCHAR,
    product_id VARCHAR,
    event_type VARCHAR
) WITH (
    kafka_topic='customer_behavior',
    value_format='json'
);

CREATE STREAM customer_purchases AS
SELECT customer_id, product_id
FROM customer_behavior
WHERE event_type = 'purchase';
```

- Machine Learning Model
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import pandas as pd
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

consumer = KafkaConsumer('customer_behavior', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8')))
purchases = pd.DataFrame(columns=['customer_id', 'product_id'])

for message in consumer:
    purchases = purchases.append(message.value, ignore_index=True)

nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5)
nn.fit(purchases[['product_id']])

def generate_recommendations(customer_id):
    customer_purchases = purchases[purchases['customer_id'] == customer_id]
    distances, indices = nn.kneighbors(customer_purchases[['product_id']])
    recommended_products = purchases.iloc[indices[0]]['product_id']
    return recommended_products
```


-3. Security Implementation

In  building  our' personalized product recommendation app using ksqlDB' and
integrating it with  machine learning, we follow the steps outlined below. 
This approach integrates ksqlDB and machine learning into a Kafka data pipeline,
allowing for real-time processing and recommendations.

Architecture Overview:
1. Data Ingestion:We  Collect customer behavior data (e.g., clicks, purchases) and product information.
2. ksqlDB: We Use ksqlDB to process the data in real-time and create a stream of customer behavior events.
3. Machine Learning: Train a machine learning model to provide personalized product recommendations based on customer behavior.
4. Recommendation Engine: Use the trained model to generate recommendations for each customer.

- Code:

 Step 1: Create a Kafka Topic
First, create a Kafka topic to store customer behavior data.

```bash
kafka-topics --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic customer_behavior
```

 Step 2: Send Customer Behavior Data to Kafka
Use a Kafka producer to send customer behavior data to the Kafka topic.

```python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

# We create a Kafka producer
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))

# Send customer behavior data to Kafka
producer.send('customer_behavior', {'customer_id': '123', 'product_id': 'abc', 'event_type': 'click'})
```

Step 3: Process Customer Behavior Data with ksqlDB
Create a ksqlDB stream to process the customer behavior data.

```sql
CREATE STREAM customer_behavior (
    customer_id VARCHAR,
    product_id VARCHAR,
    event_type VARCHAR
) WITH (
    kafka_topic='customer_behavior',
    value_format='json'
);

CREATE STREAM customer_purchases AS
SELECT customer_id, product_id
FROM customer_behavior
WHERE event_type = 'purchase';
```

Step 4: Train a Machine Learning Model
Consume the processed data from ksqlDB and train a machine learning model.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import pandas as pd
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

# Consume the processed data from ksqlDB
consumer = KafkaConsumer('customer_behavior', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8')))

# Prepare data for training
purchases = pd.DataFrame(columns=['customer_id', 'product_id'])

for message in consumer:
    # Append new data to the DataFrame
    purchases = purchases.append(message.value, ignore_index=True)

# Train a nearest neighbors model
nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5)
nn.fit(purchases[['product_id']])
```

Step 5: Generate Recommendations
Define a function to generate recommendations based on the trained model.

```python
def generate_recommendations(customer_id):
    # Get the customer's purchase history
    customer_purchases = purchases[purchases['customer_id'] == customer_id]

    # Get the nearest neighbors
    distances, indices = nn.kneighbors(customer_purchases[['product_id']])

    # Get the recommended products
    recommended_products = purchases.iloc[indices[0]]['product_id']

    return recommended_products
```

2. Developmental Setup

- -Kafka: Install and configure Kafka on our local machine or server.
- -ksqlDB: Set up ksqlDB to process streams.
- -Python Environment: Use a virtual environment and install necessary packages
-  like `kafka-python`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`.



C. Middleware API for Gmail Messages

Use a Node.js middleware to handle incoming Gmail messages.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { google } = require('googleapis');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/gmail-webhook', async (req, res) => {
    const { email, subject, message } = req.body;
    // Process the incoming Gmail message
    console.log(`Received email from ${email}: ${subject}`);
    res.status(200).send('Email processed');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

D. Webhooks for the App

Set up a webhook endpoint to receive events.

```javascript
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
    const event = req.body;
    console.log('Received webhook event:', event);
    // Process the event
    res.status(200).send('Event received');
});
```

 F. Redis for Caching Data

Use Redis to cache data for quick access.

```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

client.on('connect', () => {
    console.log('Connected to Redis');
});

// Set cache
client.set('key', 'value', redis.print);

// Get cache
client.get('key', (err, reply) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(reply);
});
```

G. Retry Logic

Implement retry logic using the `retry` package.

```javascript
const retry = require('retry');

function fetchData(callback) {
    const operation = retry.operation({ retries: 3, factor: 2, minTimeout: 1000 });

    operation.attempt((currentAttempt) => {
        // Simulate a network call
        const success = Math.random() > 0.5;
        if (success) {
            callback(null, 'Data fetched successfully');
        } else {
            if (operation.retry(new Error('Failed to fetch data'))) {
                return;
            }
            callback(operation.mainError());
        }
    });
}

fetchData((err, result) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Failed:', err);
    } else {
        console.log(result);
    }
});
```

H. API Handling with Postman

Use Postman to test API endpoints independently. Create a collection in Postman and add requests to test each endpoint, such as `/gmail-webhook` and `/webhook`.

 I. Error Handling

Implement error handling in your application.

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

 J. Debugging

Use `console.log` for basic debugging or more advanced tools 
like `nodemon` for live reloading and `debug` for selective logging.

```bash
# Install nodemon
npm install -g nodemon

# Run your app with nodemon
nodemon app.js
```

K. Monitoring

We use a monitoring tool like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your application.

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3000']
```
